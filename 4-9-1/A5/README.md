# Particle System

Create a particle system. 

* Your choice of exactly what it does is up to you. 
* You must start out with random positions. 
* You must also randomize at least two other components of the animation (velocity, color, point size, birth time, death time, opacity, etc.). 
* The particles must follow some sort of prescribed motion. (that is, it must look intentional).

## Requirements:
* Position randomized at the start
* One other item randomized at the start
* A second other item randomized at the start
* Position changing during the animation
* Some sort of deliberate motion
