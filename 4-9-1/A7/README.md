# Spring Mesh

Create a chain spring mesh where all nodes can move in 2D.
Its motion will be like a Slinky dangling from your hand.

## Requirements:
* Motion behaves correctly when: 
	* X0,Y0 is moved
	* the Mass (Mass) is changed
	* the Spring Constant (K) is changed
	* the Damping Coefficient (Cd) is changed
	* Gravity is changed
