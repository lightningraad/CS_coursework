```
1.) Contained in one single file, called "mypython.py".

2.) When executed, creates 3 files in the same directory as your script, each named 
     differently & remain there after your script finishes executing. 
      Each of these 3 files must contain exactly 10 random lowercase characters.
      With no spaces, & the final (11th) character pf each file MUST be a [\n].

3.) When executed, output sent to stdout should first print out the contents 
      of the 3 files it is creating in exactly the format given below.

4.) After the file contents of all three files have been printed, print out 
      two random integers each on a separate line (whose range is from 1 to 42, inclusive).
