## The Sun to Mars - Small Scale Solar System
For my final project, Iâ€™ve built a scene which resembles our solar system from the
Sun up until Mars:
* Mercury, Venus, Earth, & Mars will all be spheres with planet texture Maps
* The Sun will be in the center and emit a point light
* Each of the planets will orbit the sun at different distances & speeds

This project uses various skills acquired through previous assignments:
* animating a scene
* texture mapping
* lighting


## Requirements:
* Create & position objects to represent the sun and each planet (proportional to each other & the set scale)
* Apply unique texture maps to each object
* Animate each object to rotate about its own axes (proportional to each other & the set scale)
* Animate each planet to orbit around the sun (proportional to each other & the set scale)
* Apply lighting - Make the sun a light source which will cast shadows on each planet
* Apply multiple outside views of Solar System

## *EXE instructions:
* right-click to open menu
	* toggle settings such as the view presets, planets' ambience, sun pointlight, etc.
* middle-click + drag to zoom
* left-click to rotate scene
* To run correctly, be sure to have:
	* each texture file (.bmp)'s
	* glew32.dll
	* freeglut.dll
	* the executable
